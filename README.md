# Easy Eyes

The **Easy Eyes** Visual Studio Code theme is designed to reduce eye strain and fatigue when coding for extended periods of time. The colors and font formatting used in the theme are carefully chosen to make important information stand out and provide a clear, concise overview of the code, while also being easy on the eyes.

**Easy Eyes** highlights important details and provides a clear, concise view of the code, helping you quickly understand its structure and organization. This can reduce the time and effort needed to read and work with the code, and lower the potential for eye strain and fatigue when coding for extended periods of time.

**Easy Eyes** comes in two versions: **Normal** and **Night**. The **Night** version is a toned down version of the **Normal** theme, intended to be used in low light conditions to further reduce eye strain.
