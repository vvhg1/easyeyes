**Easy Eyes** is a theme for Visual Studio Code that has been created to reduce eye strain when coding for extended periods.
The colors have been chosen to provide a good contrast between them and to be easy on the eyes. Most important information should be easy to spot at a glance while semantic coloring offers a good overview and distinguishability of the code.
The theme is intended to be used with semantic highlighting enabled.

This theme comes in two versions: **Normal** and **Night**. The **Night** version is a darker version of the **Normal** one. The **Night** version is intended to be used in low light conditions to reduce eye strain even more.
